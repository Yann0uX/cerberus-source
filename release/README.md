# Cerberus release processes

[Cerberus](http://www.cerberus-testing.org/) is an user-friendly automated testing framework.

This project is the entry point to release Cerberus project modules.

## Get started

This project defines a set of release processes, each of them represented by a `.cmds` file.

A `.cmds` file gathers all necessary commands to be executed in order to apply a release process. These commands can be executed thanks to the [runcmds](https://github.com/abourdon/runcmds) command execution tool.
 
Finally, each `.cmds` file contains a documentation header part to describe how to use it.

### step by step

Clone runcmds.sh somewhere on your computer :
`
git clone https://github.com/abourdon/runcmds
`

Go to your cerberus/release folder
`
    cd <path_to_cerberusclone>/release/
`


And run the release cmd :
`
 <path_to_runcmds>/runcmds.sh
       -e RELEASE_VERSION <release version> \
       -e NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_VERSION <next development version> \
       -e RUNCMDS_PATH <runcmds command path> \
       -s ./common.cmds
`

`common.cmds` will clone a cerberus on release/cerberus-testing, change some version on bin/*.sh script and make a `mvn release`.
After that, common.cmds will wait new version of cerberus is available on sourceforge, and create new docker version.
